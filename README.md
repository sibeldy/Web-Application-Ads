# Web-Application-Ads
Location Based Advertisements

The project is a web application which aims to show advertisements based on the location of user. Advertisements are defined by the shops and they have a specific time interval. Users are able to list currently available advertisements for any selected distance and category. The web application is compatible with PC, mobile and tablet.

The system has two main parts. First part consists of the shops’ interface where shops have to register to the system and define ads. The second part consists of the user interface where users reach advertisements, list them by category and distance, and see the shop’s location from map.
